# vowel_reverse.rb

This program takes any user string input and returns a string whose vowels are in reverse order while its consonants remain in place.

Eg. "Hello World" => "Hollo Werld"

This program will follow Test-Driven Development:

* Tests are written before the program
* A failing test is written first
* Code is written to pass the test
* A failing test is written for a new feature
* Code is written to pass the test, and refactored
etc...
