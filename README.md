# vowel_reverse.rb

This program takes any user string input and returns a string whose vowels are in reverse order while its consonants remain in place.

Eg. "Hello World" => "Hollo Werld"

Development on this program will follow Test-Driven Development:

* Tests are written before the program
* A failing test is written first
* Code is written to pass the test
* A failing test is written for a new feature
* Code is written to pass the test, and refactored
* Repeat until done!

Development on this program will follow a branching git workflow:

* New features are developed on a new branch, locally
* Once that feature is finished, it is pushed to GitHub, remotely
* A pull request will be created, reviewed and merged
* The master branch will be pulled into the local branch
* Repeat until done!
